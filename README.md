# Hockey Schedule Helper
## Download the latest season schedule
- Find the latest NHL schedule. 
- 2021-2022 is available here: https://media.nhl.com/public/news/15224?sf148953190=1
- Download: "MBS by Team and Network as of 13-Aug-2021 13-59.xls"

## Prepare the CSV
- Open the document in Excel and save the "MBS" sheet as CSV
- Delete row at the bottom of the sheet with the "Generated by Link Fri Aug 13 13:59:37 EDT 2021" text.
- Delete Rows 1:7 and save. 
- Double check the CSV looks fine.

## Setup tables in your database and import data
- Run the following SQL in your database (I used MariaDB/DBeaver on my local machine):
  - "1 - create_dates_dimension.sql"
  - "2 - create_team_schedule.sql"
- Import the CSV into the table titled `team_schedule`
- Check the correct number of rows were imported against the number or rows in the CSV:  
    `select count(*) from team_schedule ts;`

## Create the final CSV
- Run the 2 scripts in "3 - schedule_helper.sql"
- Export the output of the streaming and schedule view to a CSV titled `schedule_helper.csv`
